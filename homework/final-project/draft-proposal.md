For my final project, I am proposing using the computational programming skills to go through and analyze the Crunchbase data about the past and current startup economic landscape.

I am specifically interested in seeing what kinds and types of companies have been popular, both in starting up and in attracting the attention of capital and investments. This interest is largely spurred because of something I learned at the State of the Valley Conference, during which a panel discussed how startups today are aiming to take on industries that have largely been controlled within the civic, government sphere, such as transportation and education.

I plan on first exploring these two areas first, to see what these different data points look like for these two fields, and if they do in fact match up with my hypothesis that they have both seen an increase in players coming into the field and money coming in as investment.

These scripts can then be deployed to explore other company areas within the dataset. I think it’d be worthwhile to do a simple grep-based script to compile the most popular company market areas and see what the growth has been like in these regards in the recent years. 

Some manual work will have to be done first. The database needs to be cleaned up a bit, and it will need to be joined (probably using SQL) between companies and investment data. And in order to incorporate other datasets, I am thinking I can incorporate government data on private fundraising, as well as specific datasets relating to transportation and education. I can see what government activity has looked like in those regards, as well as see what people’s behavior has been like that has perhaps demanded an increase in startup activity in this sphere (people’s commute times, online activity for higher education, etc).
